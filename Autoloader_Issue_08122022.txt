Case is being lowered to a Sev B until the morning.  Software engineer is working with Databricks at this time to investigate why the queue message encoding is changing after leaving AQS.

I'm in at 8 AM Pacific and I'll raise the severity then.  Software engineering and Databricks team will continue their work on it regardless of what this case severity is set to, as they have a separate ticket in a separate system.

FYI.... The issue was produced due to recent update done by Event grid team. Event grid team has provided a script to resolve the issue for now. DB team working internally on the script shared.

I am going to be offline for an hour or so to cook/eat dinner. Will check back in after.

Perfect, thank Bill Carroll for the updates

EventGrid team had this outage Incident 326385693 where the original issue was communicated with customers. Per Azure Eventgrid expert, this issue was a result of a regression that resulted in messages being encoded with incorrect message type for a few hours. This was already known and reported to customers with a way to fix the impacted messages. See IcM 326385693 for details.

[Yesterday 7:08 PM] Bill Carroll
Seems there is some script to fix the messages, will see if I can get it. That seems to be out next steps. Will probably be tomorrow.
